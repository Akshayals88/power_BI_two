political dashboard

# Power BI Dashboard

I have created this dashboard using Excel, Power BI, and Python to analyze the Uttar Pradesh State Election Report. This report covers different political parties, including BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), SP (Samajwadi Party), and BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party).

Key Features of the Dashboard:
Visualization of Election Data:

Includes multiple charts such as bar charts, line charts, and donut charts to represent data.

Displays the number of male and female voters supporting different parties.

Caste and Religion-Based Analysis:

The report categorizes voters based on caste, category, and religion to provide deeper insights.

MLA and Vote Share Trends:

Displays the number of MLAs and vote share of different parties across various years.

Incorporates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track election trends.

District-Wise Comparison (2022 vs. 2017):

Compares vote shares by district in the 2022 and 2017 elections to identify trends and shifts in voter preferences.

In-Depth Analysis:
This project provides a comprehensive overview of Uttar Pradesh's election results using data-driven insights and interactive visualizations.
